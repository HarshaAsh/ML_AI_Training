    "If you're starting out on programming, this week you will be full of new concepts and ideas. It is helpful to think of learning a programming language much like learning any new language. As with any language, you will learn the *syntax* and the *semantics* of Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax is the structure of the language: what constructs and statements are valid. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dog moose cow.\n",
    "\n",
    "is just a sequence of nouns and not syntactically valid English. When interacting with a computer through Python, we will have to be very precise with the syntax of our commands -- if we mistype a command, our program will stop running and produce an error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics, roughly speaking, is the meaning of the statements we make. In addition to the right syntax, we also need to use correct semantics: for example,  \n",
    "\n",
    "    My dog flew the kitchen sink to Hawaii.\n",
    "\n",
    "is grammatically correct but doesn't make sense in English. Similarly, we'll learn how to construct Python statements to interact with a computer. Semantical errors in code can be more difficult to catch than syntax errors as our program may appear to run just fine, but then produce the wrong result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll go through many key features of how the Python programming language works, in terms of both syntax and semantics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting out\n",
    "\n",
    "This session assumes that you have\n",
    "\n",
    "-   installed Python 3 with the Anaconda distribution. If you haven't yet, you can do download the distribution\n",
    "    [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Run the file and follow the instructions to install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, you should complete these steps before starting\n",
    "the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you'll work through a series of small Python exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you get stuck on a question, contact me on chat  \n",
    "-   We encourage you to chat with your colleagues and work together on the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the command line application for your system, either **terminal** (macOS) or **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows). In\n",
    "Windows, hit the Windows key and start typing `Anaconda Prompt` to open the prompt. In macOS, use the key combination Cmd-Space, then type \"terminal\" and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use the command line to navigate to the directory where you have extracted the tutorial files, including this file.** You can see this directory in the browser address bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the command line, Windows shows you the directory you're in. In macOS, you can check the current directory by typing in `pwd` (for \"print working directory\") and hitting Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the files contained in the directory by typing in `ls` (for \"list files\") in macOS or `dir` in Windows, and hitting Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know where you are, how to navigate to a different directory? You can change the directory by typing `cd` (change directory) followed by a space and the name or path of the directory. For example, if you've checked that you're currently in `/Users/my_user_name`, and you want to move into the Desktop sub-directory `/Users/my_user_name/Desktop`, you\n",
    "can type in\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "and hit Enter. You can then check `pwd` in macOS to confirm that you moved, and `ls` (or `dir` in Windows) to check the directory contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then repeat this process until you get to the desired directory. If you need to move backward to a parent directory, use `cd ..` (cd followed by a space and two dots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also move directly into the directory by entering\n",
    "the its full path. Say the tutorial files are in the folder `tut01` on\n",
    "your system's Desktop. In macOS, type or paste into the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd /Users/my_user_name/Desktop/ses01\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, type into the Anaconda Prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd c:\\Users\\my_user_name\\Desktop\\ses01\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line supports **tab completion**, which makes it easier to navigate to a folder. For example, if you're in the `my_user_name` folder and wish to move to `my_user_name\\Desktop`, you can start typing `Des` and hit the `Tab` key to complete the word `Desktop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to the tutorial directory where you extracted the files, check the contents of the directory: in macOS, use the command `ls`; in Windows, `dir`. You should see at least the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "    session_1.ipynb\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now you're ready to start the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python and the Spyder IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 0, we tried out Python on the command-line. On the command\n",
    "line, typing out\n",
    "\n",
    "    python\n",
    "\n",
    "and hitting Enter starts the Python interpreter. We can then type in\n",
    "commands, which the Python interpreter will evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('Hello!')\n",
    "    >>> 2+2\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave the Python interpreter by typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> quit()\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings you back to the normal command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start building more complex programs, this mode of running code - typing it in line by line - becomes inconvenient. A better way is to store our commands in a text file, and send the entire file to the interpreter when we want to try it out. The interpreter will read the file line by line and execute the commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These code files are often called *scripts*. They are a convenient way to save our code for future use. We can write them using any text editor, but many programmers use editors that are part of an *integrated development environment* (IDE), which aim to make programming easier and more fun in various ways. Our Anaconda installation comes with a widely-used one called **Spyder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having installed Anaconda, you should find Spyder on your laptop. Open the Anaconda Navigator or search for Spyder directly on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In Windows, press the Windows key and start typing `spyder`.\n",
    "-   in macOS, use Finder or Launchpad to find Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and open Spyder. It may take a while to load, but eventually you should see an interface like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface can look complicated at first as there are many things we can do with Spyder. Look first at the bottom right panel. This is an **IPython** console, which is an enhanced version of the Python interpreter we were just using on the command line. The main visible difference to the Python interpreter is that instead of\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "it prompts you for commands with\n",
    "\n",
    "    In [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can type in Python commands here just like in the command-line interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the console, there is a Help panel. It will display helpful information on your code, variables, and files, but we can ignore it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we will be working in the left panel, which is a text editor. We will use it to write and edit longer pieces of code. Different from the console, the code we type here will not run immediately. Instead, we'll have to invoke Spyder's commands to run our code or parts of it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**We will first work in the IPython console, and later come back to the editor.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs consist of *expressions*, which tell the computer how to combine pieces of data. One common example are numerical expressions. For example, `5` is a simple numerical expression with just a single piece of data, and `2 + 3` is an addition expression that combines the data `2` and `3` using the `+` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can enter calculations directly into the console and it will display the answer. When we do so and write `2 + 3`, Python *evaluates* this expression, and gives us the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try this out in Jupyter's console. Enter each of the following commands, one at a time. Type in or copy the command, hit return, and see what happens.\n"
