    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now introduced many key structures of programming: calculations, variable assignment, conditions, and loop structures. These are enough for us to start solving computational problems, but before we do, let us introduce another useful concept: functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use algorithms all the time in our everyday lives, and often trust someone else or a service to do so for us. For example, we give a destination to a mapping service, and get the shortest route. Or we call up an order to a restaurant, and get a fresh pizza. There is a \"map algorithm\" or \"pizza algorithm\" behind the scenes, but we don't know exactly how it works - we simply trust others to have designed it such that it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in Python, we have started using code that others have written and we trust to work. In the first session, we used the commands like:\n"
