    "functions that manipulate other functions to build higher-order\n",
    "abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a list of the squared and cubed values of the\n",
    "natural numbers up to `n`. We could do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \\[ \\]:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is repetitive. They are more or less the same function, just with\n",
    "different calculations. Because the functions share a common pattern, we\n",
    "can create an abstraction: each function creates a list of terms, but\n",
    "applying a different calculation. We do this by making the specific\n",

    "adding it to our programming language. We can then use our functions to\n",
    "express more complex operations, calculations, and patterns. Here we've\n",

    "the tweets in the list. Just now, we looped through to do some\n",
    "conversions. Examples could include finding hashtags or mentions, or\n",

    "so.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looping through a list in Python we often need to keep track of the\n",

    "        print('The value is:',item,', the index is:',index)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases we need to loop through two lists at the same time.\n",
