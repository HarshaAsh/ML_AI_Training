    "We have previously covered many key Python concepts, including the use of variables and functions, and the list data structure. In this session we'll learn to use some of Python's other compound data structures: dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Each of these has its own benefits, and we'll learn to pick the appropriate one for the kind of problem and data we're facing. We will also read data from files into Python. As our programs are starting to grow in size and complexity, we'll also go over some ways to debug code and handle errors that may occur.\n",

    "## Built-in data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several data structures built-in in its core components. You\n",
    "have already been introduced to one of them: the list. Today we'll cover\n",
    "the `dictionary`, `set`, and `tuple` structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using lists, where we could access the list contents by\n",
    "their **position** in the list. Lists are flexible and may contain\n",
    "elements of different data types. For example, we might want to keep\n",
    "track of people and their email addresses. One way to do it would be as\n",
    "follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> l = [['Sally', 'sally[at]gmail.com'], ['Fred', 'fred[at]gmail.com'], \n",
    "             ['John', 'john92[at]yahoo.com'], ['Ellie', 'ellie[at]hotmail.com']]\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to look up Ellie's email in the list. How do we do\n",
    "this? Our list is not sorted, but we could do a linear search within the\n",
    "first items of each lists to find her name, and then access her email.\n",
    "We would look up index `[0][0]`, see that it is not Ellie, then\n",
    "`[1][0]`, see that it is not Ellie, until we find Ellie, and then find\n",
    "the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is cumbersome and slow, especially if we need to do it repeatedly.\n",
    "If we keep the list sorted, we can then use binary search for a faster\n",
    "lookup, but is there a way we can do even better?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **yes**, using a *dictionary*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a mapping of **keys** to **values**. Here, we want to\n",
    "associate each name to an email address, or in other words *map* names\n",
    "to email addresses. So, the **names** are our **keys**, and the\n",
    "**emails** are the **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've set up a dictionary, we can access the values directly using\n",
    "the **key** instead of an integer index. This is much simpler than going\n",
    "through the list indices to find the right name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our dictionary is ready, we will be able to do the following (but\n",
    "not yet!):\n",
    "\n",
    "    In[1]: email_dict['Ellie']\n",
    "    Out[1]: 'ellie[at]hotmail.com'\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we create a dictionary? We put key-value pairs inside curly\n",
    "braces. Each key is followed by a colon and then its value, and the\n",
    "pairs are separated by commas. This creates a new object of dictionary\n",
    "type, which Python calls just \"dict\".\n"

    "This is the basic syntax of dictionaries.\n",

    "To recap, the dictionary is a data structure that associates keys to values. You might have observed that because of this key-value association, each dictionary key must be *unique*. So, if we want to add another friend called Ellie, we'll need to give her a different key, perhaps with her surname included.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word on the data we can use as dictionary keys and values. Dictionary values can be any Python objects (numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries...). The data types we can use keys, however, are more restricted. We can use immutable types like strings and numbers, but not mutable types like lists or other dictionaries. This is because with a mutable key like a list, the value of the key might change, and this would confound our lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keys                       | Values                               |\n",
    "|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",

    "| immutable (hashable) types | any Python objects                   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pause for a moment and think about why the dictionary structure is\n",
    "useful. As we saw above, we can achieve the same functionality using\n",
    "lists. But the dictionary is much more **intuitive** to use when looking\n",
    "up elements. With a list, we would need to write a loop to go through\n",
    "the data. With dictionary, it's also much easier to check whether a\n",
    "contact is in our address book already, and avoid accidentally adding\n",
    "the same contact twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, besides convenience, there is another crucial reason for using\n",
    "a dictionary: it is blazingly **fast**. When we look up 'Ellie' in a\n",
    "list, this is a linear time operation as we would have to loop through\n",
    "the list. In a dictionary this only takes constant time on average. This\n",
    "may surprise you: how does the dictionary avoid the looping? This has to\n",
    "do with the ingenious design of the data structure. Python Dictionaries\n",
    "are implemented as a hash table structure. We will not go into detail\n",
    "here on how they work, but you will find more information on hash tables\n",
    "in the readings for this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, dictionaries are both convenient and fast when our data\n",
    "involves **mappings from keys to values**. In some ways, you can think\n",
    "of a list as a similar mapping, but of integers to values, and\n",
    "dictionary as a mapping with more general keys. Notice however that\n",
    "**dictionaries are not sorted**, and **we cannot access the contents by\n",

    "button in the toolbar. Start the debugger use the command to run the\n",
    "next line. The color of the line where the debugger is will change as\n",
    "you go along. When you reach the line\n",
    "\n",
    "    pct_change([4, 2, 1, 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "instead of stepping to the next line, let's step *into* the function.\n",
    "This moves the execution point inside the function, where we can move\n",
    "line by line with `Ctrl+F10`. This will define the variables as we go\n",
    "along. Stepping into functions like this is useful for seeing what\n",
    "happens inside our code and what may be causing an error. The Spyder\n",
    "variable explorer on the top right hand side of the window will show you\n",
    "the values and types of the variables at any given point in time. This\n",
