    "## The knapsack problem\n",
    "\n",
    "During the lecture, we started looking at the knapsack problem. The\n",
    "problem is simple: you want to pick the most valuable items to fill out\n",
    "a 'knapsack' with limited capacity. But the applications are plentiful:\n",
    "many problems with budget constraints in finance and operations\n",
    "management are versions of the knapsack problem or closely related to\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, we start with a set of \\$n\\$ items that each have values\n",
    "\\$v_i\\$ and weights \\$w_i\\$ and are trying to maximize the total value\n",
    "of items to pick, subject to a capacity constraint \\$W\\$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\max\\_{x_i \\in \\\\0,1\\\\} \\sum\\_{i} x_i v_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{s.t. } \\sum\\_{i} x_i w_i \\le W $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the binary (0/1) version of the knapsack problem, where we\n",
    "either pick each item or do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to fill a knapsack (a budget) with generic items (eg\n",
    "projects for a firm). To implement this in Python, our object-oriented\n",
    "instincts suggest creating a `class Item`."

    "\n",
    "The solution from the greedy algorithm is not in general optimal in the\n",
    "binary case. But what is the optimal solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "For relatively small problems, we can implement a 'brute force' solution\n",
    "of the knapsack problem, which simply loops through all possible subsets\n",
    "of items that we can create from the items we have, and picks the best\n",
    "feasible one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is that there are *exponentially many*\n",
    "subsets to go through. To create the subsets, the code contains a\n",
    "function `power_set` that creates all possible subsets of a list of\n",
    "items \\$L\\$. To do this, it uses a clever Python concept called a\n",
    "*generator*: it does not try to create all the subsets at once store in\n",
    "memory - with an exponential number of subsets, this could get ugly!\n",
    "Instead, the generator creates extra subsets \"live\", that is, whenever\n",
    "we need one, it generates the next one. This is done with the keyword\n",
    "`yield`. You can read more about generators in Chapter 8.3.1 of the\n",
    "textbook. The result is that the output from the function `power_set`\n",
    "can simply be iterated through. This is done in the `brute_force`\n",
    "function that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try solving the optimal solution of the brute force algorithm for small\n",
    "problems. How fast is the greedy solution? How large problems can you\n",
    "solve via brute force? What is the complexity of the brute-force\n",
    "solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy fractional\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function `greedy_fractional` in `ses08_extra.py`, which\n",
    "solves a fractional version of the knapsack problem. In this problem,\n",
    "you can pick not just entire items but any fraction of an item. We pick\n",
    "in the same order as before, but if we cannot fit the entire item, we\n",
    "just use as much of that item as we can until the knapsack is full. In\n",
    "this case, the greedy algorithm with density sorting provides the\n",
    "optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Fantasy football\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now apply our algorithm to a potentially useful real-world\n",
    "application: fantasy football (FF). In fantasy football, you act as a\n",
    "manager of a football team in eg the Premier League and try to build the\n",
    "best team of players possible using a limited budget. FF leagues are\n",
    "popular among football fans: for example, the Premier League organizes\n",
    "an official league on its website, with significant prizes for best\n",
    "'managers'.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the the success of a FF team determined? The Premier League has a\n",
    "set of rules for this: for example, your players will get a certain\n",
    "number of points for scoring/assisting goals, keeping an empty sheet,\n",
    "being named man of the match, and so on. The league also determines the\n",
    "costs of acquiring different players into your team based on their\n",
    "popularity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably starting to see this as a knapsack problem: we have a\n",
    "limited budget, as well as costs for each player. However, we're missing\n",
    "the 'values' of different players. Determining a player's expected\n",
    "future value for your team (how many goals will they score in following\n",
    "games) may be more art than science, but one simple way to try to value\n",
    "them is to use their past performance (in terms of points already\n",
    "accumulated). The Premier League helpfully publishes the current scores\n",
    "of each player on their website. If we download this data, we have\n",
    "everything we need to solve a knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data (current as of 20/9) is include in an html file downloaded\n",
    "from the website. The Python file `ses08_extra.py` further includes\n",
    "helper functions for you to read this data into a list of players:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `read_players` takes JSON data downloaded from the Premier\n",
    "    League website containing the players values, and parses it to\n",
    "    create lists of player attributes.\n",
    "-   The `Player` class is very similar to the `Item` class, but adapted\n",
    "    for player attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow you to start building your team, we won't go into much\n",
    "detail here - you can just run the functions. But going through these\n",
    "functions later is a useful exercise to develop your skills in using\n",
    "code written by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and solve the problem using the greedy algorithm on the list of\n",
    "players and a budget constraint. Try out different budget constraints.\n",
    "What is the result? Is this what a football team looks like? What went\n",
    "wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll probably notice want to have exactly 11 players in your team, and\n",
    "at specific places too (at most a single goalkeeper too and so on). In\n",
    "the language of optimisation, this is a *cardinality constraint* on the\n",
    "knapsack problem. That is, the optimisation problem would have an\n",
    "additional constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i x_i \\le 11. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a somewhat more challenging problem. Try to implement a greedy\n",
    "heuristic with a simple way of dealing with this: when picking in the\n",

    "make sure the solution does not break any of the constraints. This is an\n",
    "open problem for you to explore, so there are no tests for this\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably not the best solution you could find. What could you do\n",
    "to improve your solution? A brute-force algorithm would find the correct\n",
    "solution, but there are many players so it will be quite slow. There are\n",
    "several optimisation methods that could help you, but these are beyond\n",
    "the scope of this course so they are left for you to explore. For\n",
    "example, you could look into dynamic programming and genetic algorithms.\n",
